# Agents Docs Directory

The entry point for all agent documentation now lives at `AGENTS.md`. Use that file for maintenance rules and the latest navigation instructions.

Please update `AGENTS.md` whenever you add new subfolders or relocate files so the directory map never falls out of sync. That file is the authoritative directory map and contains the maintenance workflow.
