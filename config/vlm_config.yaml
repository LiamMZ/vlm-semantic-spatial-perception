# Detection prompts
prompts:
  # Object detection prompt
  object_detection: |
    You are a robotic perception system analyzing a scene.

    Identify all objects in this image that are relevant for robotic manipulation.
    For each object, provide:
    1. Object type/category
    2. Approximate 2D bounding box (normalized 0-1 coordinates)
    3. Confidence score (0-1)
    4. Brief description
    5. Estimated size (small/medium/large)

    Return results as a structured JSON list.

  # Spatial relationship extraction
  spatial_relations: |
    Analyze the spatial relationships between objects in this scene.

    For each pair of objects, describe their relationship using these predicates:
    - on(obj1, obj2): obj1 is resting on obj2
    - in(obj1, obj2): obj1 is contained within obj2
    - near(obj1, obj2): obj1 is close to obj2
    - above(obj1, obj2): obj1 is positioned above obj2
    - left_of(obj1, obj2): obj1 is to the left of obj2

    Return as JSON with object pairs and relationships.

  # Scene understanding
  scene_description: |
    Describe this scene from a robot's perspective.

    Include:
    1. Overall scene type (kitchen, office, workshop, etc.)
    2. Main functional areas
    3. Objects suitable for manipulation
    4. Potential obstacles
    5. Safe navigation areas

  # Task-conditioned detection
  task_conditioned: |
    Task: {task_description}

    Analyze this scene in the context of the above task.
    Identify:
    1. Goal objects required for the task
    2. Tool objects that might be needed
    3. Obstacles that should be avoided
    4. Workspace areas suitable for the task
    5. Missing objects/preconditions

    Return as structured JSON.
